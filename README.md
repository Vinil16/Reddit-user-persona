# 🧠 Reddit User Persona Generator

This project is a creative, AI-powered script that generates **detailed user personas** by analyzing any public Reddit profile. It uses Reddit data (posts & comments) and a powerful LLM (DeepSeek via OpenRouter) to build clean, structured personas that highlight a user's personality traits, interests, habits, and motivations.

Ideal for **UX research**, **AI profiling**, or just exploring online behaviors in a meaningful way.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- 📥 Takes a Reddit user profile URL as input  
- 🔍 Scrapes their latest posts and comments using the Reddit API  
- 🤖 Sends the content to DeepSeek LLM via OpenRouter  
- 🧾 Outputs a clean, recruiter-style persona in `.txt` format (like you'd see in a UX research doc)  
- ✅ Includes motivations, frustrations, top interests, personality traits, and citations

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) – for accessing Reddit content
- [OpenRouter + DeepSeek](https://openrouter.ai) – for LLM-based persona generation
- `python-dotenv` – for managing API keys securely
