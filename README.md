#  Reddit User Persona 

This project is a creative, AI-powered script that generates **detailed user personas** by analyzing any public Reddit profile. It uses Reddit data (posts & comments) and a powerful LLM (DeepSeek via OpenRouter) to build clean, structured personas that highlight a user's personality traits, interests, habits, and motivations.

Ideal for **UX research**, **AI profiling**, or just exploring online behaviors in a meaningful way.

---

##  What It Does

-  Takes a Reddit user profile URL as input  
-  Scrapes their latest posts and comments using the Reddit API  
-  Sends the content to DeepSeek LLM via OpenRouter  
-  Outputs a clean, recruiter-style persona in `.txt` format (like you'd see in a UX research doc)  
-  Includes motivations, frustrations, top interests, personality traits, and citations

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) – for accessing Reddit content
- [OpenRouter + DeepSeek](https://openrouter.ai) – for LLM-based persona generation
- `python-dotenv` – for managing API keys securely

##  How to Run It

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reddit-user-persona.git
   cd reddit-user-persona
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with:
   ```env
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Enter a Reddit profile URL**
   Example:
   ```
    https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/
   ```

6. **Get the output**
   A text file like `kojied_persona.txt` will be created with a structured persona based on that user's Reddit activity.
